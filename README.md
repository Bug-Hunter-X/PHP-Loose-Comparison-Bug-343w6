# PHP Loose Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP programming related to loose comparison. Loose comparison (using ==) in PHP can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing values of different types.  The script `bug.php` showcases this issue, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version using strict comparison (===).
